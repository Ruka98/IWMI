# IWMI

This repository showcases the work I completed during my time at the **International Water Management Institute (IWMI)**. It includes a range of water-related research and geospatial projects focused on hydrology, water accounting, wastewater reuse, and spatial modeling.

Each **branch** in this repository represents a specific project, with all the relevant **code, resources, and outputs** included.

## 📁 Repository Overview

- 🔀 **Multiple Branches**: Each project is maintained in its own branch for clarity and version control.
- 📂 **Uploaded Files**: Includes Python scripts, GIS datasets, modeling tools, and result visualizations.
- 🧰 **Tools Used**: Python, QGIS, GDAL, PyQt, and various hydrology libraries.

## 🧪 Project Examples (in branches)

Some of the projects uploaded include:

- **Delineation of Wastewater Reuse Areas**  
  Tools and models to identify suitable reuse zones using spatial analysis.

- **Reservoir-Based Hydrological Modeling**  
  Scripts for identifying and analyzing drainage areas and potential water availability.

- **Dashboard Development for Spatial Outputs**  
  Interactive dashboards for communicating results using Python-based frameworks.
